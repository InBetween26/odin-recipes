            <li>
                <p>Turn on pressure cooker and select saute function. Add sausage and ground beef to the pot and until browned, about 5 minutes</p>
                <p>Drain and discard grease and set meat aside. Add olive oil and swirl to insure the bottom of the pot is evenly coated. Add onions</p>

                <p>Pour in chicken broth and deglaze the pot, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom. Pour in marinara sauce. Add meat mixture</p>
                <p>and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Add lasagna noodles, making sure that they are completely submerged in sauce.</p>
