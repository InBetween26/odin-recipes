First assignment - Recipe Website

This is the first assignment from the Odin Project.

The assignment is to build a recipe website using the HTML concepts introduced
in the HTML foundation block.

I will demonstrate (or at least try to) basic HTML concepts such as:
1. Working with text such as making text bold or italics
2. Making ordered and unordered list
3. Dealing with images and links
4. How to properly write commit messages
